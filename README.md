# Movie-Trailer-Project-Udacity 

This is a movie trailer website project for Udacity's full-stack [nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree). Using object class in Python, the goal of this project was to generate a static webpage displaying a listing of movies and links for each movie and its trailer video on YouTube.

## Download

The files for the project, may be [downloaded here] (https://github.com/apdrumline04/apdrumline04.github.io/blob/master/Movie_Trailer_Files.zip).

## Quick Start

After downloading the project files, a movie trailer page can be created by importing [media.py](https://github.com/anthonyrobinsonjr/MovieTrailerProject/tree/master/Movie_Trailer_Files%202) and [fresh_tomatoes.py](https://github.com/anthonyrobinsonjr/MovieTrailerProject/tree/master/Movie_Trailer_Files%202) at the start of your Python script. Then create idividual Movie objects by calling media.Movie() and supplying it with three arguments -- title, poster_url, and trailer_url. Lastly, to generate the movie trailers page, call fresh_tomatoes.open_movies_page() and supply it with an array of the movie objects you created. 

A more detailed example with multiple movie objects, which is used for the [demo](http://movietrailer.site88.net/Movie_Trailer_Files%202/fresh_tomatoes.html), can be found in [entertainment_center.py](https://github.com/anthonyrobinsonjr/MovieTrailerProject/tree/master/Movie_Trailer_Files%202)
